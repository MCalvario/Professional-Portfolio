# Week2Challenge

## Description
AS A potential employee I want an employer to view my deployed portfolio of work samples so that the employer can review samples of my work and assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position.

# Usage

To sample my previous work, load my portfolio to be presented with my recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
Click one of the links in the navigation and the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
Click on the link to the section about my work, and the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications.
You will be presented with my first application, then that application's image will be larger in size than the others
Click on the images of the applications to be taken to that deployed application.
Resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices to be presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport.
